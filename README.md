## Purpose
In order to stay organized we seperate the information we try to share/present into many different files. The problem is that when you need to recall specific information, the file names might not always be named approperately. This tool automates the searching task for you by searching through all of your powerpoint (.pptx) files in the current directory and scanning each slide it check to see if it contains your search phrase. In the event that it is able to locate your search phrase in a slide, it will then provide information as to where it has found your phrase in the format of the slide number followed by the file name.
